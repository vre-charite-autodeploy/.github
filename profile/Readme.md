Welcome to the **Charité Virtual Research Environment (VRE) AutoDeploy** organization - your gateway to automated, GDPR-compliant digital research infrastructure.

## 🚀 What is the VRE?

The Virtual Research Environment is a secure, cloud-native, **GDPR-compliant digital research platform** designed to empower researchers with secure, scalable, and collaborative tools for modern scientific discovery. Built with privacy-by-design principles, VRE provides a comprehensive ecosystem where sensitive research data can be processed, analyzed, and shared while maintaining the highest standards of data protection and regulatory compliance. This repository collection provides infrastructure-as-code automation with Terraform and Helm Charts, enabling rapid, scalable, and reproducible deployment of the GDPR-compliant VRE ecosystem on Kubernetes.
Built to meet the strict requirements of GDPR and FAIR data principles, it empowers researchers with compliant, modular, and scalable digital tools to manage, process, and share sensitive health data.

VRE is a node of the [EBRAINS Health Data Cloud](https://www.ebrains.eu/tools/healthdatacloud) and supports a wide range of neuroscience initiatives and clinical research across Europe.

### 🎯 Key Features

- **🔒 GDPR Compliance**: Built-in privacy controls and data protection mechanisms
- **☁️ Cloud-Native Architecture**: Kubernetes-based for scalability and resilience as well as Kong, Keycloak, Elasticsearch, MinIO, Neo4j, OpenLDAP, cert-manager, Jaeger, and more.
- **🔄 Automated Deployment**: One-click infrastructure provisioning with Terraform and Helm
- **🔐 Enterprise Security**: Multi-layered authentication and authorization systems
- **📊 Comprehensive Analytics**: Integrated observability and monitoring stack
- **🤝 Collaborative Workspace**: Secure data sharing and team collaboration tools


## 🛠️ AutoDeploy Architecture

This new **AutoDeploy version** revolutionizes VRE deployment through complete automation:

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform**: Automated provisioning and configuration managements – Declarative Terraform templates for each deployment phase (pre-install, install, intermediary-install, post-install).
- **Helm Charts**: Streamlined Kubernetes application deployment – Modular Kubernetes application packages for VRE components.
- **GitOps Workflow**: Version-controlled infrastructure changes
- **Secrets & Configuration Guidance**: Clearly structured guidance for secure deployment setup.
- **Scalable Environments**: Easily configure new staging or production environments using customizable .tfvars files.

### Core Components
- **Identity & Access Management**: Keycloak-based authentication with LDAP integration
- **Data Management**: MinIO object storage with encryption at rest
- **Service Mesh**: Kong API gateway for secure service communication  
- **Observability Stack**: Elasticsearch, monitoring, and distributed tracing
- **Database Layer**: Neo4j graph database and Redis caching
- **Certificate Management**: Automated TLS certificate provisioning

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes cluster (≤ 1.29.x)
- Storage provider with RWO/RWX support
- LoadBalancer capability

### One-Command Deployment
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vre-charite-dev/vre-infra.git
cd vre-infra

# Configure your environment
cp ./terraform/config/charite/charite.tfvars ./terraform/config/production/production.tfvars
vi ./terraform/config/production/production.tfvars

# Deploy VRE
export TF_VAR_ghcr_token="username:token"
export TF_VAR_kubeconfig="/path/to/kubeconfig"

# Automated deployment across all stages
FOLDERS=("pre-install" "install" "intermediary-install" "post-install")
for TF_FOLDER in "${FOLDERS[@]}"; do
  terraform -chdir=./terraform/${TF_FOLDER} init
  terraform -chdir=./terraform/${TF_FOLDER} apply --auto-approve -var-file=../config/production/production.tfvars
done
```
